# Pong-Game
This repository contains my implementation of the classic Pong game, built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It served as a hands-on project that helped me learn, exercise, and apply core frontend technologies by building an interactive web application.

## Getting Started
To play the game:
1. Clone this repository
2. Open `index.html` in your browser
3. Enjoy!
